Welcome to my Simple Calculator.

I'm almost positive the name speaks for itself. It's a calculator and it's fairly simple. It took me about 4 hours to code this up.
It's in Visual Basic which I'm sure people despise and hate with a passion but to me, Visual Basic is the absolute best.

Aside from peoples preferred languages, this application is just meant to make simple calculations. I'm working on some design changes at
at the moment as well as adding some functions to the calculator.

Aside from that, enjoy editing or even downloading and using it!

Thanks for reading,
